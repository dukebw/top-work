    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      If you love the flavors of Margherita Pizza or Caprese Salad (tomatoes,
      basil and fresh mozzarella cheese), then give this simple, summery
      frittata a try! Serve it with a colorful green salad for lunch, brunch or
      dinner.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>8 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 tbsp milk or cream</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper (about ½ tsp each)</li>
      <li>2 tsp olive oil or butter</li>
      <li>3.5 oz/100 g soft, FRESH mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>1 plum tomato, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp basil pesto (see variation below for non-pesto version)</li>
      <li>Chopped fresh basil for garnish (pictured)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt and pepper until well
        blended and a bit frothy.
      </li>
      <li>Heat olive oil in non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add egg mixture.</li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until
        edges look like they’re beginning to set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a rubber spatula, raise the edges of the frittata so that any
        uncooked egg runs underneath.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook 2 to 3 more minutes, until top is still a bit wet but
        almost cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat oven broiler but leave rack in center position.
      </li>
      <li>Layer slices of mozzarella and tomatoes over eggs in skillet.</li>
      <li>Dot with small dollops of pesto.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer skillet to oven and broil frittata for 1 to 2 minutes, until
        cheese is melted and eggs are completely cooked and slightly browned
        around edges. Be careful not to burn it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove frittata from oven and sprinkle with fresh basil (optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool 5 minutes before slicing and serving. (This frittata tastes
        better and is easier to slice when it’s warm and not hot.)
      </li>
    </ol>
